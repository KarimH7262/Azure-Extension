Hello team,

The extension can only be enabled from the MDFC portal. I share the steps below â€“ 

1.	From the Azure portal, open Defender for Cloud.
2.	From Defender for Cloud's menu, open the Recommendations page.
3.	Select the recommendation Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution.
4.	From the list of unhealthy machines, select the ones to receive a vulnerability assessment solution and select Remediate. Choose the recommended option, Deploy integrated vulnerability scanner, and Proceed.
5.	You'll be asked for one further confirmation. Select Remediate.
6.	The scanner extension will be installed on all of the selected machines within a few minutes.

Hope that helps. I re-share the article shared previously for your reference - Defender for Cloud's integrated vulnerability assessment solution for Azure, hybrid, and multicloud machines | Microsoft Docs

Thank you.
